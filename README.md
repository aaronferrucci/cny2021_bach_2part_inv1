# cny2021_bach_2part_inv1
J.S. Bach's 2-part invention #1 for 2 CNY2021 boards. The rev 1 (red) board
plays the right hand, the white rev 2 board the left.

I only put in the first 6 measures (plus one 1/8th note), but if anyone wants
to continue, the sheet music is [here](https://www.virtualsheetmusic.com/score/Invenzioni.html).

The CNY2021 boards don't have an accurate clock, so you may need to do some
tuning. Look in the right-hand (red, rev1 board) code for that; it's just one
number to adjust.
